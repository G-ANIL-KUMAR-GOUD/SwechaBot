# Project Report: Streamlit Chatbot using Hugging Face DialoGPT

## 1. Introduction
This project implements a conversational AI chatbot using **Streamlit** for the frontend, **PyTorch** for computation, and **Hugging Face Transformers** for the language model.  
It provides a lightweight and interactive UI for real-time conversations.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional chatbots are either too rigid (rule-based) or require complex infrastructure.  
The goal is to create a **simple yet powerful chatbot** that is easy to deploy locally or on the web.

## 3. System Design
- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based interface for real-time chat.
- **Backend**: Hugging Face DialoGPT-medium model for natural language generation.
- **Context Handling**: Maintains conversation history across turns.

## 4. Implementation
- Python 3.8+
- Hugging Face Transformers (DialoGPT-medium).
- Streamlit for UI.
- Requirements listed in requirements.txt.

## 5. Results
- Smooth conversational flow.
- Real-time chatbot interaction.
- Option to reset conversation history.

## 6. Conclusion & Future Scope
The chatbot demonstrates a practical integration of Hugging Face models into a Streamlit app.  
Future improvements may include:
- Support for multilingual conversations.
- Integration with speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
- Deployment on cloud platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.
